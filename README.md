Yprogs
========

Information
-----------
A small window, with six configurable buttons to open folders.  
The buttons are configurable in the yprogs.ini with the caption and path.

To avoid having a massive amount of shortcuts in the taskbar or desktop.  
Just launch it via a shortcut or hotkey.

**The only dependency is kivy**

Usage
-----
**If you have kivy portable**, you will need to execute the yprogs.py in its own folder with the kivy.bat.
```
cd Python\Yprogs
C:\Path\to\kivy\kivy.bat yprogs.py
```
If you have kivy installed as module, just run it.  
`python yprogs.py`

*Do whatever you want with this code.*  
*Just show me what awesome things you did.*
